# fp_book_club_ts
Exercises and notes from [Functional Programming in Scala][fpinscala] translated to [TypeScript][ts].

## Running the code

1. Install the version of node specified in .node-version (10.6.0 as of this writing). On a Mac, using nodenv, do:
   ```
   $ brew update
   $ brew upgrade node-build
   $ nodenv install 10.6.0
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   $ npm install
   ```
3. Run the TypeScript REPL...
   ```
   $ npm run console

   > fp_book_club_ts@0.0.1 console ~/src/fp_book_club_ts
   > ts-node

   > console.log("Hi there!");
   Hi there!
   undefined
   >
   ```
4. ...Or run the tests...
   ```
   $ npm test

   > fp_book_club_ts@0.0.1 test ~/src/fp_book_club_ts
   > jest

    PASS  fpbookclub/intro/cafe.test.ts
     âœ“ returns a Coffee (51ms)

     console.log fpbookclub/intro/impure_example.ts:13
       Side effect! Charging the credit card...

   Time:        0.896s, estimated 1s
   ```
5. ...Or run the affected tests on every file change...
   ```
   $ npm run test:watch
   ```
6. ...Or run all the tests on every file change...
   ```
   $ npm run test:watchAll
   ```

We use [Jest][jest] as our test framework, via [ts-jest][ts-jest]. In addition to the top-level scripts listed above,
you can invoke Jest with arbitrary arguments with `npm test -- [--jestArg1 --jestArg2 ...]`. To see everything Jest can
do for you, run `npm test -- --help`.

## Working with the documentation

The notes, under docs_src, are meant to be deployed using [GitHub Pages][ghpages]. We use [VuePress][vuepress] to write
the notes in Markdown and render them to plain old HTML.

To update the notes:
1. run `npm run docs:dev`, and point your browser to the address displayed by VuePress, which is likely
   http://localhost:8080.
2. Edit the source files in `docs_src/`, proofreading as you go in the browser.
3. When you're done, run `npm run docs:build`, which will result in changes to the HTML under `docs/`. Commit all the
   changes under both `docs_src/` and `docs/`, merge to master if necessary, and push.
4. GitHub looks for changes to the static site assets under `docs/`. If it finds changes, it redeployes the site at
   http://calebharris.github.io/fp_book_club_ts.
